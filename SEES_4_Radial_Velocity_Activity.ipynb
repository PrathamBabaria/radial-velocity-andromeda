Specifically NASA's [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/yba/M31_velocity/spectrum/doppler_more.html) offers a great explanation of the Doppler shift and the exact equation for a Doppler shifted wavelength.

Velocity is represented by $\\upsilon$ and speed, $c_{0}$, will be the speed of light, in this astronomy case. So you will need to know the value for the constant, speed of light. Choose a variable name for $c_{0}$ and assign it the proper value in kilometers per second.\n",
